## Abstract

The issue of reproducibility often comes up in the context of published research and the need to accompany such research with the data, analyses, software/code necessary to recreate the results. As statistics educators who teach data analysis, we should be instilling best practices in students as early as possible. We advocate for teaching data analysis at all levels of the statistics curriculum using a completely reproducible framework so that the new researchers we train have no other workflow than a reproducible one. Additionally, as statisticians we should be marshaling efforts for promoting reproducible data analysis practices in other disciplines as well. While all this might sound like a tall order at first, modern tools for literate programming (e.g. R Markdown) and systems for version control (e.g. GitHub, Open Science Framework) paired with carefully designed curricula that integrate the use of these tools early and often make this goal easier to attain than ever before. In this talk we will share experiences from undergraduate courses and research experiences teaching and practicing reproducible data analysis. We will also discuss collaborative efforts with non-statisticians for developing and promoting the use of a reproducible data analysis protocol.

## Talk outline

- Two pronged approach to spreading reproducibility:
	+ Convince researchers to change their workflows and adopt reproducible ones
	+ Train new researchers who have no other workflow -- this talk focused on this prong
- Share experiences from undergraduate courses that teach data analysis within a reproducibile framework
	+ Intro stat - toolkit: R + RStudio + R Markdown
	+ Intro data science - toolkit: R + RStudio + R Markdown + git + Github
	+ Advanced stat computing - toolkit: R + RStudio + R Markdown + git + Github + Testing / Continuous Integration
- 2016/2017 projects: Carry the theme of reproducibility through the entire major with a capstone course and senior thesis that is fully reproducible
- Pleasant side-effects:
	+ For instructor: easy Q&A + easy grading
	+ For student: easy collaboration + self promotion
- More comments on toolkit:
	+ Recommend a workflow in R
	+ But R not necessary, any scripting language might work (even though the overhead in some might be more than others)
	+ Highlight projects for reproducibile data analysis in other languages:
		- Project TIER
		- Others?
